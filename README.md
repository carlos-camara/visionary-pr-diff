> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Visionary PR Diff** is a professional Chrome extension architected to eliminate visual uncertainty. It injects a pixel-perfect "Difference" view directly into GitHub's file diff UI, allowing engineers to surgically identify subtle visual regressions that the human eye might miss.

## 🚀 Key Impact

- **🧠 Pixel-Level Intelligence**: Automatically identifies and highlights exact pixel modifications between original and updated images.
- **🛡️ Quality Guardrails**: Prevents accidental UI regressions by providing absolute clarity in Pull Request reviews.
- **✨ Premium Integration**: Seamlessly injects a high-fidelity "Visual Diff" button into the standard GitHub UX.
- **🚥 Enterprise Standards**: Built with Manifest V3 and styled with a sleek glassmorphism aesthetic for top-tier performance.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **DOM Observation**: The engine monitors GitHub's "Files changed" section for image modifications.
2. **Action Injection**: A surgical **Visual Diff** button is injected into the header of every detected image file.
3. **Canvas Processing**: Upon activation, the engine extracts the "Before" and "After" images and processes them through an HTML5 Canvas-based bitwise comparison.
4. **Visual Result**: A high-fidelity modal overlay renders the difference map, highlighting changes in surgical magenta.
