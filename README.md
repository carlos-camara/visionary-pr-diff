  *Surgical precision in every pixel. Clarity in every Pull Request.*

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Pixel-Level Intelligence**: Automatically identifies and highlights exact pixel modifications between original and updated images.
- **🛡️ Quality Guardrails**: Prevents accidental UI regressions by providing absolute clarity in Pull Request reviews.
- **✨ Premium Integration**: Seamlessly injects a high-fidelity "Visual Diff" button into the standard GitHub UX.
- **🚥 Enterprise Standards**: Built with Manifest V3 and styled with a sleek glassmorphism aesthetic for top-tier performance.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **DOM Observation**: The engine monitors GitHub's "Files changed" section for image modifications.
2. **Action Injection**: A surgical **Visual Diff** button is injected into the header of every detected image file.
3. **Canvas Processing**: Upon activation, the engine extracts the "Before" and "After" images and processes them through an HTML5 Canvas-based bitwise comparison.
4. **Visual Result**: A high-fidelity modal overlay renders the difference map, highlighting changes in surgical magenta.

## 🍱 Advanced View Modes

Visionary PR Diff provides three distinct modes of analysis to ensure no visual regression goes undetected:

<br />

### 📐 1. The "Default 2-up" (Side-by-Side)
![2-up Comparison](media/screenshots/2-up.JPG)
*The classic architectural comparison. Ideal for verifying general layouts and structural integrity where side-by-side context is paramount.*

<br />

### 💎 2. The "Visionary 3-up" (Symmetrical Differential)
![3-up Comparison](media/screenshots/3-up.JPG)
*Our flagship mode. Provides perfect architectural symmetry by rendering the **Source**, **Difference Map (Surgical Magenta)**, and **Target** in a single, high-fidelity view. This is the gold standard for pixel-perfect verification.*

<br />

### ↔️ 3. The "Dynamic Swipe" (Interactive Overlay)
![Swipe Comparison](media/screenshots/swipe.JPG)
*An interactive slider that allows you to "wipe" the new version over the old one. Perfect for detecting subtle 1-pixel shifts or font-rendering changes that side-by-side views might miss.*
